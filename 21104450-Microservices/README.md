1. What do database migrations do and why are they useful?
Database migrations give you the ability to manage database changes gradually. Tasks such as creating tables, adding columns, or updating constraints can be applied and tracked individually with the help of version control. This makes it easier to implement consistency through automation and collaboration.


2. How does GraphQL differ from REST for CRUD operations?
GraphQL is more flexible than REST because you request only the data you need from a single endpoint. It also lets you combine multiple queries in one request, reducing extra calls. Plus, it has a strict schema, making APIs easier to understand and use.
